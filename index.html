<h1>Battle of Star</h1>
<p>Battle of Star is our final homework of the Object-Oriented Programming course in School of Software Engineering, Tongji University. And it's our first game.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Cocos2d-x is a C++ game framework with some useful WYSIWYG tools. But here we implement all the UI features with code. We design the game considering those aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only level will become boring quickly. So we need to add battles.</li>
<li>The game should provide a way for us to battle with other people. That means network.</li>
<li>Also, including computer player into game is better.</li>
<li>Although it's a game, but teacher will focus more on code, logic rather than user interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>So we decide to create a ball game, in which players can find entertainment when having battle with remote players. According to rule of curling, player should take some actions to use his stars to hit the opponent's stars out of map. And because the game may have infinite occasions, its experience is promoted.</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<p>In fact, the game is not complicated, but still has several great features.</p>
<h3>Network</h3>
<p>When click into game, player send request to the server. Server receives it and find if there's any match to this player. If so, two players are set into a room with unique room id stored in server. When player shoot the ball, game instances in both sides will do synchronization. When game is over, server will send game result (win, lose or draw) to players.</p>
<h3>server</h3>
<p>Client communicate with server writted by Node.js which is nonblocking mechanism. And Socket.io library is helpful to build a low delay and immediate communication. Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. And it works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed.</p>
<h3>Matching system</h3>
<p>First of all, we thought it's difficult to build a matching system. But we made it. Find online players to start a game automatically. If find a room whose member number is one, player will join it. If every roomâ€™s member number is two, server will create a new room for player.</p>
<h3>Different balls</h3>
<p>We have more than one kind of ball. In this game, we design three kinds of balls: star, earth and sun with different dampings, masses and radius. That brings diverse choices to game.</p>
<h3>AI</h3>
<p>We have a silly AI player with a simple algorithm as short as no more than five lines of code. But sometimes it's really interesting if you decide to make a showdown with it.</p>
<h3>Rich in game elements</h3>
<p>We have many game details, like time counting down, collision audio, etc. We coded all of them by hand instead of generating tools.</p>
<h2>Design</h2>
<p>The whole process of game is keep the style of starry so that we choose musics and images which are fixed to the theme of it.</p>
<p>Moon, earth and sun represent different types of ball. They have various physical feature like volume, mass, force, air drag etc. They also are designed to fix the theme of starry. </p>
